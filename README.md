README for perl-cgi-test.pl

This perl script helps in testing a cgi-bin installation and has instructions to use system perl as well as perlbrew perls.  The script lists the perl version being used, the execution time and the file last modified date 

This perl cgi-bin script works as a cgi test file and works with your system perl and has example for how to use perlbrew perls too.  Basically change the shbang to use perlbrew perls.

This file, perl-cgi-test.pl, was created and runs on Ubuntu Linux. It should be mostly portable using different versions of Linux and perl.

The script uses two different perl version methods.

The script also prints execution time and when the file was last updated
