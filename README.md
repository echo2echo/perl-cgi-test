# perl-cgi-test.pl

This perl cgi-bin script works as a cgi test file and works with your system perl and has example for how to use perlbrew perls too.  Basically change the shbang to use perlbrew perls.
This file, perl-cgi-test.pl, was created and runs on Ubuntu Linux. It should be mostly portable using different versions of Linux and perl.

The script uses two different perl version methods.

The script also prints execution time and when the file was last updated
